/**
 * English values that Hindi legitimately repeats.
 *
 * The completeness test treats `hi === en` as an untranslated string, because that is
 * exactly how one hides: it satisfies the type, it is not missing, and it reads as
 * English at the counter. These are the real exceptions — a brand name, a tax
 * abbreviation, a string made only of placeholders — and each one has to earn its
 * place. A companion test fails if an entry here no longer matches any such pair, so
 * the list cannot outlive the strings it excused.
 *
 * Adding to this list is not the way to make a failing test pass. Translating is.
